                        Hey there! I’m glad you stopped by!
                        <br><br>
                        My name is Daniele , I’m a 21 years old student from Lithuania , studying 3rd semester of Multimedia Design at KEA - Copenhagen School of Design and Technology in Copenhagen. If you were wondering what am I like , let me give you a small brief -
                        I am very social, cannot spend a day alone in my house!
                        I love to create and come up with different ideas.
                        Very multicultural person. Have lived and travelled in many places.
                        Helping people is something that drives me to become a better version of myself.
                        Best rule to follow - communication is the key.
                        <br><br>
                        For as long as I can remember, from day one, I was drawn to creativity and arts. I would usually express myself through different forms of art - painting, drawing, writing and so on. Since years have been changinging not by hours, but by minutes, I knew that in order to contribute towards the world's improvement, I had to find a new form of expression. Yes, you guessed it - I came across multimedia design.
                        Multimedia design at KEA not only was able to provide me with different kinds of knowledge but also helped to open other doors. I was able to gain basic skills for coding to online marketing and working with different clients in groups.
